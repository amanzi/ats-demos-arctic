Met Data:
===================

All Met data should provide the following fields:

- "time [s]"
- "precipitation rain [m s^-1]"
- "precipitation snow [m SWE s^-1]"
- "air temperature [K]"
"relative humidity [-]"
- "incoming shortwave radiation [W m^-2]"
- "incoming longwave radiation [W m^-2]"  (optional!)
- "wind speed [m s^-1]"
- "wind speed height [m]"

Note that typically "time" is daily averages, and starts with 0 with
an interval of 86400 (seconds per day).


Data Products:
=================

spinup-10yr.h5:
-----------------

(Joel Rowland)
- 10 years (1 year data repeated 10 times)
- weather stations aroudn Barrow, window average (average all Jan 1 across 10 years, for all days)
- 2 meter wind speed reference height
- adjusted for undercatch to increase snowpack to reasonable sizes

variations:

- spinup-10yr-snowJan1.h5 is the same but dumps 35 cm of snow on
  Jan 1 of the first year to make up for the lack of most of fall's
  snowpack.  This is necessary for 2D runs where settng 35 cm as a
  uniform initial condition misses filtering that snowpack through the
  snow distribution model.

- spinup-10yr-T+6.h5 is a hack that simply increases the daily air
  temperature by 6 degrees to have something to work with for Seward.
  This will be replaced with real Seward data, and then should be
  removed.

- spinup-10yr-snowJan1-T+6.h5 does both of the above

Barrow-2010_2013.h5
---------------------
(Anna Liljedahl, her student at UAF?, Nathan Wales, others)

- Meterological data taken from various sources, includign teh Barrow
  airport and eddy flux towers in the BEO, then corrected using
  snowpack surveys and others.

- Jan 1 2010 -- Dec 31 2013 by Anna and her student, 2014 -- 20?? by
  Nathan Wales

- daily averaged

Barrow-2014_2016.h5
-----------------------
(Adam Atchley collected)

- Temp, precip, & RH data:
    From CRN: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/qcdatasets.html
              https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/uscrn/products/daily01/
    Temp was converted from C to K.
    Precip was categorized as snow if temp<=0 degrees C and rain if temp>0 degrees C.
    snow = rain*1.3 to correct for undercatch

- Wind speed data (350cm height):
  From mini met towers @ polygons (Bob Busey @ UAF):
  http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov/data/#fq=datasource%3A%22NGEE%20Arctic%22&q=busey
  originally hourly averages, converted to daily averages.  Data is from mini met-tower in Area C.
  note: A lot of 0.45 values between 20160110 and 20160222

  alternative source for wind speed data (ARM):
  http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::Barrow AK wind /ffac::nsa.C1

- Radiation data:

  shortwave:
  From ARM
  http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/fcat::radio/fsrc::armobs,armderiv,extobs,extderiv/fsite::nsa
  *REMEMBER TO ADD d_sw_hem + d_sw_diff to get shortwave radiation

  longwave:
  From mini met towers @ polygons (Bob Busey @ UAF):
  http://ngee-arctic.ornl.gov/data/#fq=datasource%3A%22NGEE%20Arctic%22&q=busey
  originally hourly averages, converted to daily averages.  Data is from mini met-tower in Area C.
